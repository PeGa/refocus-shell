## Installation

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PeGa/refocus-shell
cd refocus-shell

# Run the interactive installer
./setup.sh install
```

The installer will:
- Detect your Linux distribution
- Install required dependencies (`sqlite3`, `notify-send`, `jq`)
- Set up the database and configuration
- Offer installation method choice (Function vs Script)
- Configure shell integration for prompt modification
- Set up cron jobs for nudging functionality

### Installation Methods

Refocus Shell offers two installation methods:

#### Function Installation (Recommended)
- **Automatic prompt updates** - no manual `update-prompt` calls needed
- **Works in all shell environments** - bash, zsh, etc.
- **Seamless integration** - `focus` command available immediately
- **Default choice** for new installations

#### Script Installation (Traditional)
- **Traditional executable script** - works like any other command
- **Manual prompt updates** - requires `update-prompt` calls
- **May need PATH configuration** - depends on installation location
- **Backward compatibility** - for users who prefer explicit control

### Non-Interactive Installation

For automated deployments or CI/CD:

```bash
# Auto-install with all defaults
./setup.sh install --auto

# Verbose output for debugging
./setup.sh install --auto --verbose
```

### Installation Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--auto` | Non-interactive installation with defaults |
| `--verbose` | Show detailed installation steps |
| `--help` | Show installation help |

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
focus on "project"     # Start focusing on a project
focus off              # Stop current focus session
focus status           # Show current focus status
focus help             # Show all available commands
```

### Session Notes

When you end a focus session with `focus off`, you'll be prompted to add notes about what you accomplished:

```bash
$ focus off

üìù What did you accomplish during this focus session?
   (Press Enter to skip, or type a brief description)
Implemented user authentication system
Stopped focus on: coding (Duration: 2h 15m)
   Notes: Implemented user authentication system
```

**Benefits:**
- **Prevents context loss**: Remember what you accomplished months later
- **Better reporting**: See what was done in each session
- **Professional records**: Track work for invoices, reports, or retrospectives
- **Intentional closure**: Encourages mindful session endings

**Adding Notes to Past Sessions:**
You can also add notes to past sessions using the `focus notes` command:

```bash
$ focus notes add coding
üìù Adding notes to recent session for: coding
   Start: 2025-01-15 14:30:00
   End: 2025-01-15 16:45:00
   Duration: 135 minutes

What did you accomplish during this focus session?
   (Press Enter to skip, or type a brief description)
Fixed critical bug in user authentication
‚úÖ Notes added to session 42
```

### Quick Examples

```bash
# Start focusing
focus on "coding"
focus on "meeting"
focus on "planning"

# Check status
focus status

# Stop focusing
focus off

# Add past sessions with flexible timestamps (will prompt for session notes)
focus past add "project" "2025/07/30-14:00" "2025/07/30-16:00"  # Add past focus session
focus past add "meeting" "14:00" "15:30"           # Today's times
focus past add "coding" "2025/07/30-14:00" "16:00" # Specific date
focus past add "planning" "2 hours ago" "1 hour ago" # Relative times

# Generate reports
focus report today
focus report week
focus report month
focus report custom 7  # Last 7 days

# Manage data
focus export backup.sql
focus import backup.sql
focus reset  # Reset all data (with confirmation)
```

### Smart Focus Continuation

Refocus Shell remembers your last project and session:

```bash
$ focus on "coding"
Started focus on: coding

$ focus off
Stopped focus on: coding (Duration: 2h 15m)

$ focus on  # No project specified
Started focus on: coding  # Continues last project
```

### Enhanced Status Information

Get rich context about your focus:

```bash
$ focus status
‚è≥ [coding] Started: 14:30 (2h 15m ago)
üìä Total time on coding: 12h 45m (across 8 sessions)
üïê Last session: coding (2h 15m, ended 2h 15m ago)
üí° Tip: Run 'focus report today' to see today's summary
```

### Cumulative Time Tracking

Refocus Shell tracks total time across all sessions:

```bash
$ focus report today
üìä Today's Work Summary
=======================

‚è∞ Total focus time: 6h 30m
üìã Total sessions: 4
üéØ Active projects: 2

üìà Project Breakdown:
  coding: 4h 15m (2 sessions)
  meeting: 2h 15m (2 sessions)

üìÖ Recent Sessions:
  1. coding (14:30-16:45, 2h 15m)
  2. meeting (10:00-12:15, 2h 15m)
  3. coding (09:00-11:00, 2h 00m)
  4. meeting (08:00-09:00, 1h 00m)
```

### Past Session Management

Add, modify, and delete historical focus sessions with flexible timestamp formats:

```bash
# Add past sessions
focus past add "meeting" "14:00" "15:30"                          # Today's times
focus past add "coding" "2025/07/30-14:00" "2025/07/30-16:00"     # Specific date
focus past add "planning" "2 hours ago" "1 hour ago"               # Relative times
focus past add "review" "yesterday 14:00" "yesterday 16:00"       # Yesterday
focus past add "team meeting" "2025/07/30-14:00" "2025/07/30-16:00" # Full date

# List recent sessions
focus past list 10

# Modify a session
focus past modify 1 "new-project" "2025/07/30-15:00" "2025/07/30-17:00"

# Delete a session
focus past delete 1
```

### Session Notes Management

Add notes to past sessions to maintain context:

```bash
# Add notes to the most recent session for a project
focus notes add "coding"
focus notes add "meeting"
```

**Supported Date Formats:**
- `YYYY/MM/DD-HH:MM` (recommended: `2025/07/30-14:30`)
- `HH:MM` (today's date)
- `'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'` (quoted datetime)
- `'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM'` (ISO format)
- Relative dates (`'yesterday 14:30'`, `'2 hours ago'`, etc.)

**Data Backup:**
- SQLite dump format (`.sql` files)
- Complete database backup including schema and data
- Automatic timestamped filenames
- Safe import with backup creation

### Discrete Session Management

Track focus and idle sessions separately:

```bash
$ focus on "coding"
Started focus on: coding

$ focus off
Stopped focus on: coding (Duration: 1h 30m)
Idle time detected: 15m (will be tracked separately)

$ focus status
‚è≥ [coding] Started: 14:30 (1h 30m ago)
üìä Total time on coding: 8h 45m (across 6 sessions)
üïê Last session: coding (1h 30m, ended 1h 30m ago)
üí§ Idle time: 15m (since last session)
```

### Focus Reports

Generate detailed markdown reports:

```bash
# Today's report
focus report today

# This week's report
focus report week

# This month's report
focus report month

# Custom period (last 7 days)
focus report custom 7
```

Example report output:
```markdown
# Work Report - 2025-07-30

## Summary
- **Total work time**: 6h 30m
- **Total sessions**: 4
- **Active projects**: 2

## Project Breakdown
| Project | Sessions | Total Time |
|---------|----------|------------|
| coding  | 2        | 4h 15m     |
| meeting | 2        | 2h 15m     |

## Recent Sessions
1. **coding** (14:30-16:45, 2h 15m)
2. **meeting** (10:00-12:15, 2h 15m)
3. **coding** (09:00-11:00, 2h 00m)
4. **meeting** (08:00-09:00, 1h 00m)
```

### Nudging System

Get periodic reminders to check your focus status:

```bash
# Enable focus reminders (every 10 minutes)
focus nudge enable

# Check nudging status and next reminder time
focus nudge status

# Test the notification system
focus nudge test

# Disable focus reminders
focus nudge disable

# Legacy: Test notifications (deprecated)
focus test-nudge

# Check nudging status
focus status  # Shows if nudging is enabled

# Disable nudging (if needed)
focus config set NUDGING false
```

**Improved Reliability:**
- **Multiple notification methods**: Desktop notifications, terminal messages, and system logs
- **Automatic fallbacks**: If desktop notifications fail, falls back to terminal messages
- **Better error handling**: Comprehensive logging and error reporting
- **Database validation**: Checks database integrity before sending notifications
- **Environment resilience**: Works reliably in cron and user environments

Nudging occurs in real-time when you start a focus session and shows:
- Current project and session duration
- Total time on the project
- Gentle reminder to take breaks

**Real-Time Nudging:**
- **Automatic**: Cron jobs are installed/removed automatically with focus sessions
- **Perfect Timing**: Nudges start exactly when you begin working, not at arbitrary times
- **Session-Based**: Only active during actual focus sessions, completely silent otherwise
- **Smart Scheduling**: Uses your actual start time to calculate optimal nudge intervals

**Troubleshooting:**
If nudges don't appear:
1. Check if nudging is enabled: `focus nudge status`
2. Test the system: `focus nudge test`
3. Check system logs: `journalctl --since "1 hour ago" | grep focus-nudge`
4. Verify cron job: `crontab -l | grep focus-nudge`

### Data Import/Export

Backup and restore your focus data:

```bash
# Export all data to SQLite dump
focus export backup.sql

# Import data from SQLite dump
focus import backup.sql

# Export with timestamped filename
focus export  # Creates focus-export-20250802_143022.sql
```

### Configuration

View and modify settings:

```bash
# Show current configuration
focus config show

# Set verbose mode
focus config set VERBOSE true

# Set notification timeout
focus config set NOTIFICATION_TIMEOUT 10000

# Reset to defaults
focus config reset
```

Available settings:
- `VERBOSE`: Enable detailed output
- `NOTIFICATIONS`: Enable/disable desktop notifications
- `NUDGING`: Enable/disable periodic reminders
- `NUDGE_INTERVAL`: Minutes between nudges (default: 10)
- `IDLE_THRESHOLD`: Minutes before idle detection (default: 60)
- `MAX_PROJECT_LENGTH`: Maximum project name length (default: 100)
- `REPORT_LIMIT`: Number of sessions in reports (default: 20)

## Uninstallation

```bash
# Run the uninstaller
./setup.sh uninstall

# Or uninstall non-interactively
./setup.sh uninstall --auto
```

The uninstaller will:
- Remove all refocus shell files and directories
- Clean up shell integration (prompt functions)
- Remove cron jobs
- Optionally delete the database (with confirmation)
- Create backups of modified configuration files

## Dependencies

Refocus Shell requires these system packages:

### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install sqlite3 libnotify-bin
```

### Arch/Manjaro
```bash
sudo pacman -S sqlite libnotify
```

### Fedora/RHEL
```bash
sudo dnf install sqlite libnotify
```

### openSUSE
```bash
sudo zypper install sqlite3 libnotify-tools
```

## Database

Refocus Shell uses SQLite for data storage:

- **Location**: `~/.local/refocus/refocus.db`
- **Tables**: `state` (current session), `sessions` (historical data)
- **Backup**: Use `focus export` for data backup
- **Reset**: Use `focus reset` to clear all data

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Current work state
CREATE TABLE state (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    active INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    project TEXT,
    start_time TEXT,
    prompt_content TEXT,
    prompt_type TEXT DEFAULT 'default',
    nudging_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT 1,
    work_disabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0,
    last_work_off_time TEXT
);

-- Historical sessions
CREATE TABLE sessions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    project TEXT NOT NULL,
    start_time TEXT NOT NULL,
    end_time TEXT NOT NULL,
    duration_seconds INTEGER NOT NULL,
    notes TEXT
);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"focus command not found"**
```bash
# Reinstall and source bashrc
./setup.sh install --auto
source ~/.bashrc
```

**"update-prompt: command not found"**
```bash
# Reinstall with function method
./setup.sh install --auto
