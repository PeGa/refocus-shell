## Who Should Use This?

- **Neurodivergent users** (ADHD/autistic) seeking better time awareness without overwhelming complexity
- **Developers and sysadmins** who need **low-friction structure** for billable hour tracking
- **Freelancers** tired of guessing where their hours went
- **People who want to respect their own pace**, not corporate metrics
- **Anyone who wants local-first, privacy-respecting workflow tools**
- **People who don't want their productivity tools to spy on them**

> üí° **Pro Tip**: The `‚è≥ [project]` prompt tag works **across all terminals** - start focus in one terminal, and every new terminal you open will show your current project!

## Installation

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PeGa/refocus-shell
cd refocus-shell

# Run the interactive installer
./setup.sh install
```

The installer will:
- Detect your Linux distribution
- Install required dependencies (`sqlite3`, `notify-send`, `jq`)
- Set up the database and configuration
- Offer installation method choice (Function vs Script)
- Configure shell integration for prompt modification
- Set up cron jobs for nudging functionality

### Installation Methods

Refocus Shell offers two installation methods:

#### Function Installation (Recommended)
- **Automatic prompt updates** - no manual `update-prompt` calls needed
- **Works in all shell environments** - bash, zsh, etc.
- **Seamless integration** - `focus` command available immediately
- **Default choice** for new installations

#### Script Installation (Traditional)
- **Traditional executable script** - works like any other command
- **Manual prompt updates** - requires `update-prompt` calls
- **May need PATH configuration** - depends on installation location
- **Backward compatibility** - for users who prefer explicit control

### Non-Interactive Installation

For automated deployments or CI/CD:

```bash
# Auto-install with all defaults
./setup.sh install --auto

# Verbose output for debugging
./setup.sh install --auto --verbose
```

### Installation Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--auto` | Non-interactive installation with defaults |
| `--verbose` | Show detailed installation steps |
| `--help` | Show installation help |

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
focus on "project"     # Start focusing on a project
focus off              # Stop current focus session
focus status           # Show current focus status
focus help             # Show all available commands
```

### Quick Examples

```bash
# Start focusing
focus on "coding"
focus on "meeting"
focus on "planning"

# Check status
focus status

# Stop focusing
focus off

# Add past sessions with flexible timestamps
focus past add "project" "2025/07/30-14:00" "2025/07/30-16:00"  # Add past focus session
focus past add "meeting" "14:00" "15:30"           # Today's times
focus past add "coding" "2025/07/30-14:00" "16:00" # Specific date
focus past add "planning" "2 hours ago" "1 hour ago" # Relative times

# Generate reports
focus report today
focus report week
focus report month
focus report custom 7  # Last 7 days

# Manage data
focus export backup.sql
focus import backup.sql
focus reset  # Reset all data (with confirmation)
```

### Smart Focus Continuation

Refocus Shell remembers your last project and session:

```bash
$ focus on "coding"
Started focus on: coding

$ focus off
Stopped focus on: coding (Duration: 2h 15m)

$ focus on  # No project specified
Started focus on: coding  # Continues last project
```

### Enhanced Status Information

Get rich context about your focus:

```bash
$ focus status
‚è≥ [coding] Started: 14:30 (2h 15m ago)
üìã This is my main development project for the web application
üìä Total time on coding: 12h 45m (across 8 sessions)
üïê Last session: coding (2h 15m, ended 2h 15m ago)
üí° Tip: Run 'focus report today' to see today's summary
```

### Project Descriptions

Add context and clarity to your projects with optional descriptions:

```bash
# Set a project description
focus project set "coding" "Main development project for the web application"

# View a project description
focus project show "coding"

# List all projects with descriptions
focus project list

# Remove a project description
focus project remove "coding"
```

**Benefits:**
- **Distinguish similar projects**: "meeting" vs "meeting-client" vs "meeting-team"
- **Quick context**: Remember what a project was about months later
- **Better reporting**: Understand your work patterns with descriptive context
- **Lightweight documentation**: Simple notes without complex project management overhead

**Example workflow:**
```bash
$ focus project set "refactor" "Refactoring the authentication system to use OAuth2"
$ focus on refactor
$ focus status
‚è≥ Focusing on: refactor ‚Äî 0m elapsed
üìã Refactoring the authentication system to use OAuth2
```

### Nudging System

Get periodic reminders to check your focus status:

```bash
# Test notifications
focus test-nudge

# Check nudging status
focus status  # Shows if nudging is enabled

# Disable nudging (if needed)
focus config set NUDGING false
```

Nudging occurs every 10 minutes via cron and shows:
- Current project and session duration
- Total time on the project
- Gentle reminder to take breaks

### Data Import/Export

Backup and restore your focus data, including project descriptions:

```bash
# Export all data to SQLite dump
focus export backup.sql

# Import data from SQLite dump
focus import backup.sql

# Export with timestamped filename
focus export  # Creates focus-export-20250802_143022.sql
```

**Export includes:**
- Database schema and all tables
- All focus sessions and timing data
- Current focus state and configuration
- **Project descriptions and metadata**
- Complete data integrity for backup/restore

### Configuration

View and modify settings:

```bash
# Show current configuration
focus config show

# Set verbose mode
focus config set VERBOSE true

# Set notification timeout
focus config set NOTIFICATION_TIMEOUT 10000

# Reset to defaults
focus config reset
```

Available settings:
- `VERBOSE`: Enable detailed output
- `NOTIFICATIONS`: Enable/disable desktop notifications
- `NUDGING`: Enable/disable periodic reminders
- `NUDGE_INTERVAL`: Minutes between nudges (default: 10)
- `IDLE_THRESHOLD`: Minutes before idle detection (default: 60)
- `MAX_PROJECT_LENGTH`: Maximum project name length (default: 100)
- `REPORT_LIMIT`: Number of sessions in reports (default: 20)

## Uninstallation

```bash
# Run the uninstaller
./setup.sh uninstall

# Or uninstall non-interactively
./setup.sh uninstall --auto
```

The uninstaller will:
- Remove all refocus shell files and directories
- Clean up shell integration (prompt functions)
- Remove cron jobs
- Optionally delete the database (with confirmation)
- Create backups of modified configuration files
