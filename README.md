# Work Manager

A privacy-first, FLOSS command-line tool for tracking work sessions with intelligent nudging and cross-device synchronization capabilities.

## Features

- **Core Work Tracking**: `work on/off/status` commands
- **Desktop Notifications**: `notify-send` integration
- **Shell Integration**: Dynamic prompt modification with `‚è≥ [Project]` indicator
- **Intelligent Nudging**: Periodic reminders every 10 minutes via cron
- **Work Manager Control**: `work enable/disable` commands
- **Data Import/Export**: JSON-based backup and restore functionality
- **Professional Installation**: Interactive setup with dependency management
- **Cross-Distribution Support**: Ubuntu/Debian, Arch/Manjaro, Fedora/RHEL, openSUSE
- **Verbose Mode**: `--verbose` flag for debugging

## Installation

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd work-manager

# Run the interactive installer
./setup.sh install
```

The installer will:
- Detect your Linux distribution
- Install required dependencies (`sqlite3`, `notify-send`, `jq`)
- Set up the database and configuration
- Install the `work` command system-wide
- Configure shell integration for prompt modification
- Set up cron jobs for nudging functionality

### Manual Installation

If you prefer manual installation:

```bash
# Install dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian example)
sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libnotify-bin jq

# Run setup
./setup.sh install
```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
work on "project-name"    # Start tracking work on a project
work off                  # Stop tracking work
work status               # Show current work status
```

### Advanced Commands

```bash
work enable               # Enable work manager functionality
work disable              # Disable work manager (stops active sessions)
work test-nudge           # Send manual nudge notification (testing)
work export [file]        # Export data to JSON file
work import <file>        # Import data from JSON file
work reset                # Reset database (delete all data)
```

### Options

```bash
work --verbose            # Show detailed output
```

### Examples

```bash
# Start working on a project
work on "website-redesign"

# Check status
work status

# Export your data
work export my-backup.json

# Import data from another device
work import backup.json

# Test nudging functionality
work test-nudge
```

## Nudging System

Work Manager includes an intelligent nudging system that periodically reminds you about your work status:

- **Active Work**: "You're working on: [Project] (X minutes elapsed)"
- **No Active Work**: "You're not working on any project"
- **Configurable**: 10-minute intervals by default
- **Privacy-First**: No external services, runs locally via cron

### Control Nudging

```bash
work enable               # Enable nudging (default)
work disable              # Disable nudging
work test-nudge           # Send manual test notification
```

## Data Import/Export

Work Manager supports JSON-based data backup and restoration:

### Export Data

```bash
work export                    # Export to timestamped file
work export my-data.json      # Export to specific file
```

### Import Data

```bash
work import backup.json        # Import from JSON file
```

The import system uses a **merge strategy** rather than full override, preserving existing data while adding imported sessions.

## Verbose Mode

Use `--verbose` for detailed output and debugging:

```bash
work --verbose on "project"   # Detailed startup information
work --verbose status         # Show database queries and state
work --verbose export         # Show export details
```

## Uninstallation

To completely remove Work Manager:

```bash
./setup.sh uninstall
```

This will:
- Remove the `work` command
- Remove cron jobs for nudging
- Remove shell integration
- Optionally remove the database (you'll be prompted)

## Dependencies

- **sqlite3**: Database storage
- **notify-send**: Desktop notifications
- **jq**: JSON processing for import/export
- **bash**: Shell scripting (already available on Linux)

## Database

Work Manager uses SQLite for data storage:

- **Location**: `~/.local/work/timelog.db`
- **Tables**: `sessions` (work history), `state` (current status)
- **Schema**: Includes support for nudging, prompts, and sync features

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in `~/.local/work/config.sh`:

```bash
# Nudging interval in minutes
WORK_NUDGE_INTERVAL=10

# Logging facility
WORK_LOG_FACILITY="user"

# Logging priority
WORK_LOG_PRIORITY="notice"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"work command not found"**
```bash
# Clear shell command cache
hash -r

# Or reinstall
./setup.sh install
```

**"notify-send not available"**
```bash
# Install notification daemon
sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin  # Ubuntu/Debian
sudo pacman -S libnotify           # Arch/Manjaro
```

**"Database not found"**
```bash
# Reinitialize database
./setup.sh reset
```

**Nudging not working**
```bash
# Test manually
work test-nudge

# Check cron jobs
crontab -l

# Reinstall nudging
./setup.sh install
```

**Import/Export issues**
```bash
# Check JSON format
jq . your-file.json

# Verify dependencies
which jq
```
