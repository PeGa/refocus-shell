## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
work on "project-name"    # Start tracking work on a project
work on                   # Continue with last project (interactive)
work off                  # Stop tracking work
work status               # Show current work status
work past add "project" <minutes>    # Add past work session
work past modify "project" <minutes>  # Modify session duration
work past delete "project"            # Delete a session
work report today        # Today's work report
work report week         # This week's report
work report month        # This month's report
work report custom <N>   # Last N days report
```

### Advanced Commands

```bash
work enable               # Enable work manager functionality
work disable              # Disable work manager (stops active sessions)
work test-nudge           # Send manual nudge notification (testing)
work export [file]        # Export data to JSON file
work import <file>        # Import data from JSON file
work reset                # Reset database (delete all data)
```

### Options

```bash
work --verbose            # Show detailed output
```

### Examples

```bash
# Start working on a project
work on "website-redesign"

# Continue with last project (interactive)
work on

# Check status (shows last session when not working)
work status

# Add a past work session (45 minutes)
work past add "meeting" 45

# Modify an existing session duration
work past modify "coding" 120

# Generate work reports
work report today              # Today's summary
work report custom 7           # Last 7 days

# Export your data
work export my-backup.json

# Import data from another device
work import backup.json

# Test nudging functionality
work test-nudge
```

## Smart Work Continuation

Work Manager intelligently remembers your last project and makes it easy to continue:

- **Last Project Detection**: When you run `work on` without a project, it asks if you want to continue with your last project
- **Interactive Confirmation**: "Last project was: [Project]. Continue? (Y/n)"
- **Graceful Handling**: If you decline, it provides helpful guidance
- **No Project Fallback**: If no previous project exists, it guides you to specify a project

### Example:
```bash
$ work on
Last project was: website-redesign
Continue? (Y/n)
y
Started work on: website-redesign
```

## Enhanced Status Information

When you're not currently working, `work status` provides rich context about your last session:

- **Last Session Details**: Shows project name and duration
- **Time Tracking**: Displays how long since your last work session
- **Clear Formatting**: Uses emojis and clear labels for better readability

### Example:
```bash
$ work status
‚úÖ Not currently tracking work.
üìä Last session: website-redesign (45m)
‚è∞ Time since last work: 2h 15m
```

## Cumulative Time Tracking

Work Manager tracks total time invested in each project across multiple sessions:

- **Total Time Display**: When continuing a project, shows accumulated time from all previous sessions
- **Current + Total**: `work status` shows both current session time and total project time
- **Smart Continuation**: `work on` without project shows total time when continuing
- **Motivation Boost**: See your total investment in each project

### Examples:
```bash
# Continue with previous project (shows total time)
$ work on
Last project was: website-redesign
Continue? (Y/n)
y
Started work on: website-redesign (Total: 12m)

# Check status (shows current + total)
$ work status
‚è≥ Working on: website-redesign ‚Äî 2m elapsed (Total: 12m)

# New project (no previous time)
$ work on "new-project"
Started work on: new-project

$ work status
‚è≥ Working on: new-project ‚Äî 0m elapsed
```

## Past Session Management

Work Manager allows you to manage historical work sessions that may have been missed or need adjustment:

- **Add Past Sessions**: `work past add "project" <minutes>` - Add a session that ended X minutes ago
- **Modify Sessions**: `work past modify "project" <minutes>` - Change the duration of an existing session
- **Delete Sessions**: `work past delete "project"` - Remove a session with confirmation
- **Smart Timestamps**: Sessions are created with end time = now, start time = X minutes ago
- **Validation**: Input validation ensures proper project names and time values

### Example:
```bash
$ work past add "team-meeting" 90
‚úÖ Added past session: team-meeting (90m)

$ work past modify "coding" 180
‚úÖ Modified session: coding (180m)

$ work past delete "old-project"
üóëÔ∏è  Deleting session: old-project (45m)
Session: 2025-07-25T10:00:00-03:00 to 2025-07-25T10:45:00-03:00
Are you sure? (y/N)
‚úÖ Session deleted: old-project
```

## Discrete Session Management

Work Manager uses an ADHD-friendly approach to time tracking with discrete sessions and automatic break tracking:

- **Discrete Sessions**: Each `work on/off` cycle creates a clear session boundary
- **Automatic Break Tracking**: When you start work after a break > 60 seconds, an idle session is automatically created
- **Chronological Flow**: Reports show the natural work ‚Üí idle ‚Üí work pattern
- **Cooldown Visibility**: See your break patterns and durations for better self-awareness
- **Minimal Cognitive Load**: No manual tracking required - just work on/off as usual

### How It Works:
1. **Work Session**: `work on "project"` starts tracking
2. **Work Complete**: `work off` stops tracking and stores the session
3. **Idle Period**: Time passes between work sessions
4. **Next Work**: `work on "project"` automatically creates an idle session if break > 60 seconds
5. **Report View**: See your natural workflow with work and idle sessions in chronological order

### Benefits for ADHD:
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each session is a discrete unit of focus
- **Natural Breaks**: Idle time reflects real work patterns
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify productivity patterns and break habits
- **Reduced Guilt**: Idle time is part of the natural workflow, not "wasted" time
- **Better Planning**: Understand your actual work/break cycles

## Work Reports

Work Manager generates comprehensive markdown reports showing your work patterns and productivity insights:

- **Today's Report**: `work report today` - Shows work since 00:00 today
- **Weekly Report**: `work report week` - Shows work since Monday of current week
- **Monthly Report**: `work report month` - Shows work since 1st of current month
- **Custom Period**: `work report custom <N>` - Shows work for last N days
- **Discrete Session Tracking**: Shows work and idle sessions in chronological order
- **Automatic Break Tracking**: Captures breaks between work sessions automatically
- **Total Calculations**: Separate totals for work time and idle time

### Example Report:
```bash
$ work report today
üìÑ Report exported to: work-report-today-2025-07-25.md
# Work Report - Today (2025-07-25)

Session                             | Time        
------------------------------------|-------------
**morning-coding**                  | **1h 0m**   
*Idle*                              | *15m*       
**meeting**                         | **45m**     
*Idle*                              | *30m*       
**coding**                          | **2h 0m**   
*Idle*                              | *1h 20m*    
**planning**                        | **30m**     

**Total Work Time: 4h 15m**

*Report generated on vie 25 jul 2025 08:27:32 -03*
```

### Report Features:
- **Automatic Export**: All reports are automatically saved as markdown files
- **Fixed-Width Tables**: Clean, aligned tables that render well in terminal and markdown
- **Chronological Order**: Sessions displayed in natural work ‚Üí idle ‚Üí work flow
- **Discrete Sessions**: Each work/off cycle creates clear session boundaries
- **Automatic Break Tracking**: Breaks > 60 seconds are automatically captured
- **Time Formatting**: Hours and minutes for readability
- **Work Time Focus**: Only work time totals are highlighted (no idle totals)
- **Configurable Periods**: Flexible time windows for analysis

### Automatic Export

All work reports are automatically exported to markdown files with predictable naming:

```bash
work report today        # ‚Üí work-report-today-2025-07-25.md
work report week         # ‚Üí work-report-week-2025-07-25.md  
work report month        # ‚Üí work-report-month-2025-07.md
work report custom 7     # ‚Üí work-report-custom-7days-2025-07-25.md
```

**Benefits:**
- **Easy Sharing**: Markdown files can be shared via email, chat, or documentation
- **Automatic Archiving**: Reports are always saved for future reference
- **Clean UX**: No need to specify filenames - automatic and predictable
- **Markdown Ready**: Files render beautifully in markdown viewers

## Nudging System

Work Manager includes an intelligent nudging system that periodically reminds you about your work status:

- **Active Work**: "You're working on: [Project] (X minutes elapsed)"
- **No Active Work**: "You're not working on any project"
- **Configurable**: 10-minute intervals by default
- **Privacy-First**: No external services, runs locally via cron

### Control Nudging

```bash
work enable               # Enable nudging (default)
work disable              # Disable nudging
work test-nudge           # Send manual test notification
```

## Data Import/Export

Work Manager supports JSON-based data backup and restoration:

### Export Data

```bash
work export                    # Export to timestamped file
work export my-data.json      # Export to specific file
```

### Import Data

```bash
work import backup.json        # Import from JSON file
```

The import system uses a **merge strategy** rather than full override, preserving existing data while adding imported sessions.

## Verbose Mode

Use `--verbose` for detailed output and debugging:

```bash
work --verbose on "project"   # Detailed startup information
work --verbose status         # Show database queries and state
work --verbose export         # Show export details
```

## Uninstallation

To completely remove Work Manager:

```bash
./setup.sh uninstall
```

This will:
- Remove the `work` command
- Remove cron jobs for nudging
- Remove shell integration
- Optionally remove the database (you'll be prompted)

## Dependencies

- **sqlite3**: Database storage
- **notify-send**: Desktop notifications
- **jq**: JSON processing for import/export
- **bash**: Shell scripting (already available on Linux)

## Database

Work Manager uses SQLite for data storage:

- **Location**: `~/.local/work/timelog.db`
- **Tables**: `sessions` (work history), `state` (current status)
- **Schema**: Includes support for nudging, prompts, and sync features

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in `~/.local/work/config.sh`:

```bash
# Nudging interval in minutes
WORK_NUDGE_INTERVAL=10

# Logging facility
WORK_LOG_FACILITY="user"

# Logging priority
WORK_LOG_PRIORITY="notice"
```

## Future Features

### Automatic Idle Detection
A planned feature that will automatically detect when your device is idle (no keyboard/mouse activity) and automatically stop work tracking. This is different from the current "automatic break tracking" which creates idle sessions between work sessions.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"work command not found"**
```bash
# Clear shell command cache
hash -r

# Or reinstall
./setup.sh install
```

**"notify-send not available"**
```bash
# Install notification daemon
sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin  # Ubuntu/Debian
sudo pacman -S libnotify           # Arch/Manjaro
```

**"Database not found"**
```bash
# Reinitialize database
./setup.sh reset
```

**Nudging not working**
```bash
# Test manually
work test-nudge

# Check cron jobs
crontab -l

# Reinstall nudging
./setup.sh install
```

**Import/Export issues**
```bash
# Check JSON format
jq . your-file.json

# Verify dependencies
which jq
```
